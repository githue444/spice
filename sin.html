        // Her Turn (He pleasures her)
        const actionsForHer = [
            "G-Spot Focus: Slide two fingers deep inside her, curl them in a 'come here' motion, and find her G-spot. Apply firm, rhythmic pressure while your thumb makes slow, deliberate circles on her clit.",
            "Deep Ass Worship: Lay her on her stomach. Straddle her legs and give her a powerful, deep-tissue ass massage. Use your palms, thumbs, and the heels of your hands to press, knead, and roll her muscles, spreading her cheeks wide.",
            "Nipple Torture & Treat: Suck one nipple into your mouth, pulling on it firmly. Use your tongue to flick and swirl around the tip before switching to light, sharp bites. Alternate between rough and gentle on each breast.",
            "The Edge of Entry: Press the head of your cock against her wet folds. Grind up and down her slit with agonizing slowness, never entering, letting her feel every vein and the heat of your shaft.",
            "Primal Pin: Pin her thighs wide open with your hands. Hold her still as you rub her clit with the steady, unyielding pressure of your thumb, staring into her eyes as you do.",
            "The Over-the-Knee Spank: Pull her over your lap, face down. Deliver a series of firm, stinging spanks to each ass cheek, alternating hands. After a set of slaps, rub the sting away with your warm palm before beginning again.",
            "Spinal Kiss: Have her arch her back. Kiss a slow, wet trail from the nape of her neck all the way down her spine to the top of her ass crack, using gentle bites along the way.",
            "The Shaft Drag: Rest your cock between her ass cheeks. Slowly drag its full length up and down her crack, pressing it firmly against her, teasing her with the promise of what's to come.",
            "Inner Thigh Torment: Use just the tips of your fingernails to trace impossibly light lines up and down her inner thighs. Repeat the path over and over, getting closer to her center with each pass but never touching it.",
            "The Throat Hold: Gently wrap one hand around her throat, applying just enough pressure to make her feel your dominance. Use your other hand to finger her with two deep, slow, rhythmic strokes.",
            "Rough & Reverent: Grip her tits with force, squeezing and tugging them until she gasps. Immediately follow with soft, sweeping caresses and whispered praise about their shape and softness.",
            "The Scissor: Slide two fingers just inside her opening. Slowly and deliberately open and close them like a pair of scissors, stretching her gently with each movement.",
            "Breast Devotion: Take an entire breast into your mouth, sucking hard as if trying to pull it all in. Swirl your tongue around the whole areola, paying attention to every inch of skin.",
            "Full Body Worship: Give her a strong, seamless full-body massage. Start at her shoulders, move down her spine, knead her hips and ass, and finish by stroking down her thighs to her calves in one continuous, flowing rhythm.",
            "The Wall Press: Press her body firmly against a wall. Hook one of her legs over your hip, pinning her, and slowly grind the length of your erection against her mound.",
            "Palm Pressure: Use the firm heel of your palm to press down hard on her mound. Maintain the pressure while making slow, deep circles, feeling her clit through her folds.",
            "Neck & Lip Bite: With one hand holding her chin firmly, repeatedly bite her lower lip, pulling it gently with your teeth. Your other hand should be teasing the sensitive skin high on her inner thigh.",
            "The Leg Lift: Lay her on her back and lift her legs, resting them over your shoulders. Slowly drag your shaft up and down her exposed, dripping slit.",
            "Hip Grip Thrust: Grab her hips firmly from behind. Thrust your cock between her thighs from the back, grinding against the base of her ass without entering.",
            "The Squeeze & Suck: Place your hands on both her breasts and squeeze with alternating pressure—right, then left, right, then left. Lower your head and suck on the valley between them.",
            "Body Slide: Lie on top of her, pinning her down with your body weight. With your hands gripping her thighs, grind your full length along her slit in a slow, rocking motion.",
            "Ass Lift & Inhale: Slide your hands completely under her ass cheeks and lift her hips towards your face. Bury your nose in the crease where her thigh meets her pelvis and inhale her scent deeply while kissing the area.",
            "Head to Slit Drag: Drag the slick head of your cock from the top of her mound, down across her clit, and to her opening. Repeat this, watching her twitch with every pass.",
            "Pelvic Kiss: Kiss a slow, deliberate path up the inside of one thigh, across her lower belly just above her pubic bone, and down the other thigh. Then do it again, but slower.",
            "The Hot Breath: Hold her hips firmly. Lower your mouth so it’s an inch from her slit and breathe hot air onto her, letting her feel the warmth without any touch.",
            "The Double Trail: Use your thumbs to trace a path from her hip bones down to the top of her mound, meeting in the middle. Repeat, applying more pressure each time.",
            "Ass Frame: Frame her ass with both hands, thumbs meeting at her lower back and fingers wrapping around her cheeks. Squeeze and lift rhythmically.",
            "Underboob Tease: Ignore her nipples completely. Instead, focus on flicking, licking, and gently biting the sensitive curve on the underside of her breasts.",
            "Slow Finger Pull: Insert two fingers as deep as they’ll go. Instead of thrusting, slowly and deliberately pull them almost all the way out before sliding them back in, creating a wet, resistant rhythm.",
            "The Overhead View: Stand over her as she lies on her back. Dangle your cock just above her face, then lower it to gently brush the tip against her lips and cheeks.",
            "Inner Arm & Rib Kiss: Kiss the intensely sensitive skin of her inner arm, from her wrist to her armpit. Then, trail kisses down her rib cage, feeling her squirm.",
            "The Figure Eight: Use your thumb to trace a slow figure-eight pattern over her mound, with the center of the eight crossing directly over her clit.",
            "Shoulder Blade Focus: With her on her stomach, spend the entire time kissing, licking, and gently sucking on her shoulder blades and the muscles around them.",
            "The Hair Pull & Grind: Gently but firmly grasp a handful of her hair at the roots. Pull her head back to expose her neck while you grind your hips against hers.",
            "The Mute Button: Place your thumb firmly on her lips while you finger her with your other hand, maintaining eye contact and a steady rhythm.",
            "Calf & Ankle Massage: Kneel at her feet. Give her a deep, sensual massage concentrating only on her calves, ankles, and feet, stroking firmly up towards her knees.",
            "The Reverse Straddle: Have her straddle your chest, facing your feet. Grab her hips and press her mound against your mouth and chin, moving your head so she rubs against you.",
            "Ear & Neck Devotion: Devote the entire time to one side of her neck. Use your mouth to suck, lick, and bite from her earlobe down to her collarbone, groaning softly into her skin.",
            "The Thigh Squeeze: Kneel between her open legs. Place your hands on the outside of her thighs and squeeze them together, trapping your hard cock between them as you rock your hips.",
            "The Body Pin: Lie completely on top of her, matching your bodies limb for limb. Pin her wrists above her head and do nothing but let her feel your weight and your erection pressing into her.",
            "Belly Button Worship: Focus solely on the area around her navel. Kiss, lick, and swirl your tongue inside it and around the soft skin of her lower stomach.",
            "The Face Cradle: Cradle her face in both hands. Stare into her eyes and kiss her slowly, deeply, and passionately, letting your tongue explore her mouth while your body remains still.",
            "The Slow Spread: Place your thumbs at the center of her slit and slowly, firmly press outwards, stretching her gently as you expose her opening.",
            "The Hip Rock: Sit facing her, her legs wrapped around your waist. Grip her ass and rock her back and forth on your lap, grinding your erections together.",
            "Collarbone Nibbles: Use only your lips and teeth to gently nibble a path along her entire collarbone, from one shoulder to the other and back again.",
